#  Global Seismic Activity Analysis and Visualization

Objective: Analyze global earthquake data to understand seismic patterns and visualize earthquake events.
Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyasur965/recent-earthquakes
Suggested Tasks:
1.	Data Cleaning: Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
2.	Earthquake Distribution: Analyze the frequency and strength of earthquakes globally.
3.	Intensity Analysis: Use magnitude data to analyze the frequency of different intensity earthquakes.
4.	Geographical Analysis: Utilize latitude and longitude data to map the geographical distribution of earthquakes.
5.	Temporal Analysis: Study the temporal distribution of earthquakes, including trends across different years and seasons.
6.	Depth Analysis: Explore the relationship between earthquake depth and intensity.
7.	Impact Assessment: Assess the impact of earthquakes based on felt, cdi, and mmi measures.
8.	Tsunami Warning Analysis: Analyze the characteristics of earthquakes that trigger tsunami warnings.
9.	Alert Level Analysis: Investigate the relationship between earthquake alert levels and earthquake characteristics.
10.	Data Visualization: Present earthquake distribution, intensity, and temporal trends using charts and maps.
Requirements:
•	Use Python for data processing and analysis.
•	Employ the Pandas library for data manipulation.
•	Use Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for data visualization.
•	Document the analysis process and results in a Jupyter Notebook.
•	Submit a report that includes code, analysis results, and visualizations.
Outcomes:
•	Students will learn to clean and analyze data using Python.
•	Students will understand the characteristics of earthquake data and how to conduct geographical and temporal analyses.
•	Students will learn to use data visualization tools to present analysis results.
