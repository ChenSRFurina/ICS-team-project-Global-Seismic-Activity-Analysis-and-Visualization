# NBA_player_performence_project_in_python_class

Overview
In this project, student teams will analyze NBA player statistics to gain insights into player performance, team dynamics, and league trends. The datasets include comprehensive player statistics from both recent and historical NBA seasons. This project provides an opportunity to explore patterns and correlations within professional basketball data, such as the relationship between player performance metrics and team success, player development trajectories, and the impact of different positions on game outcomes. By applying data analysis and visualization techniques, students can uncover valuable insights that enhance their understanding of both the sport and data analytics.

Tasks
A. Data Acquisition, Understanding and Processing 
B. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization
C. Modeling Using AI-Related Tools (Optional)
D. Report
E. Presentation and Slides

A. Data Acquisition, Understanding and Processing
a)	Download the 2022-2023 per-game statistics from Basketball Reference. Obtain the historical NBA player stats from Kaggle after creating a free account.
b)	Examine the datasets to understand the structure and the different statistical metrics available.Prepossessing data such as handling missing data by either filling or removing null vlaues, correct inconsistencies.
B. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualization
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is key to understanding the relationships, trends, and patterns within the datasets. Perform statistical analyses to identify trends and correlations. For example:
a)	Analyze the relationship between player statistics and team success.
b)	Identify players who have significantly improved over time.
c)	Examine the impact of player positions on performance metrics.

C. Modeling Using AI-Related Tools (Optional)
Apply machine learning or big model-related tools to create useful applications and gain deeper insights.
Examples include:
a)	Building a predictive model to forecast a player’s future performance.
b)	Using clustering algorithms to group similar players.
c)	Applying advanced analytics to identify undervalued players.
D. Report
Write a 1-2 page report describing your implementations. Summarize your algorithm, including data acquisition, cleaning, analysis, visualizations, and modeling efforts.
You may discuss: 
1.	What data cleaning methods do you think could be applied to our approach? Additionally, if the dataset becomes larger or if there is an imbalance, how would you adapt the cleaning process in these situations?
2.	Which data visualization techniques do you believe would provide a clearer presentation of the results?
3.	What other techniques could you use to analyze the characteristics of this data?
4.	What metrics could we use to evaluate impact of different positions on game outcomes. 
5.	…
Your report for this task should be contained in a single file.

D. Presentation and Slides
Prepare a 10-minute presentation to share findings, including visualizations and key insights.
